## How to contribute to SBOL Utilities

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features
- Contributing bug fixes, features, and new utilities

## Asking questions

* SBOL utilities has [online documentation available](https://sbol-utilities.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
* If you need help and do not easily find an answer in the documentation, [ask your question in a new issue](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-utilities/issues/new). 
* Any question that you have likely indicates a shortcoming in the documentation, which we will want to fix as well.


## Reporting a bug / proposing a feature

* **Check if the bug / feature request was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-utilities/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-utilities/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

* If you are reporting a bug, it will be much easier to fix if you include a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Development Guidelines

We use GitHub to host code and documentation, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### All Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) contribution models). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. [Fork the GitHub repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've added new features, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (_make sure you enable GitHub actions in your fork!_)
5. Make that pull request! Please ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### All contributions are under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

_No proprietary or copylefted code will be accepted!_

### **Do you want to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

We strongly suggest that you propose your change in [a new issues](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-utilities/issues/new) and collect feedback before you start writing code or open a pull request.
